> ## OTP FORM 


- The initial state for the OTP component is to verify user based upon the hardcoded otp value which is <code> 1234</code> because behind the scenes opt component never communicate to Database and not logically sending opt to the user mobile no. it's initially hardcoded value to verify users is puting the right value (OTP).


> ## DRAG AND DROP COURSE CARD

- The component drag and drop is technically list of courses which is fetching from our local <code>.josn</code> file and in the card component represent data from the <code>API</code> , and main feature and challenging tast is to make course card <code>Draggable</code>. And lots of searching the right libraries, finally I choose <code>react-beautiful-dnd</code> library. 

- Each card have own option <code>Move To Top</code> <code>Move To Bottom</code> <code>Remove</code> as of now only Remove functionaliy is working and I know after sometime I'll add remaining features.

- Note: There are a <code>Batches</code> button to redirect batches details. Because without adding a navigation button to the other route is crashing in the production. That's why I added <code>Batches</code> Toggle


> ## DATA TABLE

- To Be Honest, the data table component is not fully working as of now. only have <code>Search Bar</code> functionality working and the remaining part of this componet is the <code>Pagination</code> which is not implemented right now. I'll add.
